It's been a while since the last Alloy update so it was time to update some dependencies and included modules. This version of Alloy will ship with:
* underscore 1.13.6
* moment.js 2.29.4

and many updated npm dependencies.

The default template has also been updated with some smaller tweaks to the generated code and we've fixed some parser issues.

The full list of changes is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/tidev/alloy/compare/2.0.2...2.1.0)
