## Known Issues

### iOS

There is currently a known issue when using Xcode 14.3 to build an app for production. We expect a fix for this issue in the upcoming GA
version of the 12.1.0 SDK. Until then, we advise you to use Xcode 14.2 for a stable environment.

## Report Bugs

As this is a Release Candidate Version, it's not meant to be used for production. So please test it on your apps and give feedback so we will have a **bug-free/working GA** at the end. If you run into any issues that seem related to the updates, please report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/tidev/titanium_mobile/issues).
