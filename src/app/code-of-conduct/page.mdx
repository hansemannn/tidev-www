# Code of Conduct

The Titanium community, lead by the board of directors at TiDev, Inc, is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants to learn and grow together.

We are a diverse community. Everyone is welcome here, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, educational background and level of experience, preferred programming language(s), ethnicity, nationality, age and religious affiliation.

Whether you are contributing to an official TiDev Titanium open source repository, attending a TiDev affiliated event online or offline, taking part in discussions in our community spaces such as TiDev's Titanium Community Discord, or communicating one-on-one with other community members, you agree to abide by the following rules.

## *As a member of the Titanium community, you agree to:*

**Approach interactions with thoughtfulness and care**

Use welcoming and inclusive language. For example, use non-gender-specific nouns for addressing groups of people (such as “folks,” “people” or “friends”). Always ask if you are unsure how someone would like to be addressed (such as their preferred name or pronouns). Be mindful that you may be communicating with others whose first language is not English.

**Choose collaboration over conflict**

In the Titanium community, we strive to work together to solve problems and celebrate successes. We also understand that working with technology can be challenging, and can cause a lot of frustration. In these situations, remember that everyone in the Titanium community is a real person, and deserves to be treated with respect at all times.

Be mindful that much of the community interaction and discussion happens asynchronously due to the nature of our global community, and that we will work together to solve problems and correct mistakes as soon as we can.

No one is expected to know everything and not make mistakes. Sometimes, even the most well-meaning intentions may result in unwanted outcomes – but how we respond to criticism is important. If someone criticizes our conduct or points out ways we have caused harm to someone, we listen without taking it personally and work toward a resolution – together.

**Represent the community in a positive, professional way**

As a member of the Titanium community, you are also a representative of the community. To this end, you agree to support the Code of Conduct in full, and alert community moderators of any behavior you witness that falls short of the conduct we expect.

We will not tolerate the following:

 - Violent threats or language.
 - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language relating to gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, educational background and level of experience, ethnicity, nationality, age, lifestyle choices, and religious affiliation.
 - Disrespecting people’s stated pronouns and gender identity, or current name.
 - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
 - Posting, or threatening to post, any aspect of a person’s identity or communication history without their consent.
 - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
 - Behavior that could be perceived – in any way – as sexual attention.
 - Excessive and/or sustained, uninvited disruption, communication or harassment – either in public channels/social platforms or private conversations.
 - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors

Some Titanium Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all those who participate in the Titanium Community to help us create safe, welcoming and positive community experiences.

## Enforcement

 - Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to do so immediately, even if participants do not agree with or fully acknowledge the behavior being reported.
 - Participants violating our Code of Conduct may be expelled at the discretion of community moderators. If a community moderator is not available at a particular event, the event organizer will ask violators to leave, and then report the situation to community moderators for further deliberation.

## Code of Conduct feedback

Feedback is always appreciated! If you have any feedback or suggestions on how to improve the Titanium Community Code of Conduct, please file an issue on the TiDev Organizational Docs repository here: https://github.com/tidev/organization-docs/issues
